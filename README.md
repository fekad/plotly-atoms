# pymatgen-plotly

Structure visualisation for pymatgen objects. This project was highly motivated by the [moly](https://github.com/VHchavez/moly) and [jupyter-jsmol](https://github.com/fekad/jupyter-jsmol) packages. This package generates [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) objects for visualisation. One of the the main advantage of this approach that it can be used in Jupyter notebooks and VSCode environments.

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fekad/pymatgen-plotly.git
